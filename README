Note:
- Age was adapted to age range in the data sharing file in order to protect participants' anonimity. Therefore, statistics on age cannot be reproduced from these files.
- The data file available includes all participants who agreed to data sharing, including the ones that were excluded from the analyses performed in the paper. Excluded were: Responses from people with parkinsonism (n = 10); all responses marked as incomplete for Part I (n = 8); responses marked as incomplete AND missing more than one value for Part II (n = 3); incomplete responses on the G-SAP score (n = 3).
All statistics were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0.0 by Eefke Lemmen.
